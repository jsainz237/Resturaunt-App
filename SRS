Scope:
On our app there are two sides; management side and customer side. In todayâ€™s context, where people are always in-rush, our app will help to order their food without being physically present at the location and only go for the pick up. Lots of people may order at the same time so the main purpose of this project is to bridge that gap by creating a mobile app, that will facilitate the customers to communicate with their food department in the restaurant.
The app will have a good scope in digital market as people will be able to order the food instantly plus having a login account will account they can look into their selected dishes later whenever they can. The premise behind the idea is that both the restaurant management and customers will be benefited from time consumption and quality food services under proper customer preferences. The restaurant world is an area in which mobile apps have had a large influence, and one of the highest growth rates compared to other fields.

Purpose:
The main purpose of a mobile app for a restaurant is obviously to provide the food service and become  accessible for the customer. The app will help to save time and customer can select their favorite dishes before coming to the location. On the other hand, waiting staff and the kitchen section will be able to prepare the food and get it ready on the arrival of the customers. Similarly, there is no hassle for both the sector to understand the food order. Likewise, use of this mobile app technology helps restaurant owners solidify their presence in the market while simultaneously helping them promote their brand online.
