Problem Statement:
	Creating a restaurant management system is one of the trending requirements in app building business. One of the main purposes behind creating the system is to showcase our computer skill as a senior student of UNT and finish the project on time. The proposed system will increase order accuracy and decrease the time between the customer sitting down after ordering the food and receiving it. It will also decrease the time that the customer has to wait to pay for their orders. This should increase the overall satisfaction of the customer which automatically increases the business.

We understand the users of this app especially the customer and working staffs will be having minimal knowledge of the computer literacy so we will be more focusing on easy and quick access for each types of users for their respective sections. 


# Users and Their Goals
There are 4 different users for this software: the customer, the wait staff, the kitchen, and management. Each type of user is only expected to have a minimal amount of computer literacy. The overall goal of the system to make the restaurant experience quick and easy to use for each type of usr.

List of users:
•Customer: 
	One of the users of the system who will be ordering and paying for the items. They can also register an account so that the name pops up for next time and use it under their own accounts. 
	
•Kitchen:
	This department will use the app to get instructions on what to prepare and notify the waiters if the food is ready or not.
	
•Waiting staffs:
	These people use the app to enter the food items of the customers and call them up or say serve after the food is being ready. They need to notify the kitchen after and have good communication with them.
	
•Management:
	The app can be used under management system where the manager or the owner will be able to see the reports, edit the menu items or change the price in order to handle the financial aspects. Also, they will be responsible to perform the customer satisfaction actions where they will be focusing on answering the customer reviews.

•Admin:
	The creator of this app should be able to modify the features on time-being even after creating the app on the request of the owner of the restaurant. 
	
•Others: 
Other people who do not want to order the food but still check on the app for their future reference.
