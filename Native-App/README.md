# React-Native App

### To start running application:

1. install expo-cli using `npm install -g expo-cli`. You may need to use `sudo`.
2. Install the expo app on your smartphone
3. cd into `Native-App` folder inside of project
4. run `npm start` to run the development server.
5. When the browser shows up, select `Tunnel` as connetion type, then scan the barcode on your phone and follow the link.

When making changes, the app will automatically reload and show you those changes, which is pretty neat.
