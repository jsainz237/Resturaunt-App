### Web-API:
- To boot up API, first make sure you have gradle installed.
   - To check, run `gradle` and it will output a list of options.

- navigate to the API folder by using `cd API`

- run `gradle wrapper` to wrap the project in gradle

- To start up the API server, run `./gradlew bootRun`

Now you should be able to go to http:localhost:8080/greeting and get a response from the API server
